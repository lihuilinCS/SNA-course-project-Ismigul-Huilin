After running OO, we collected .coord file </br>
After running BL, we collected .txt file </br>


</br>
</br>

Both files contains the new positions of nodes. </br >

When we plot, the new layout is based on these new postions, but keep the orginal edges.</br>

Becasue the graph datasets are too huge, and some of them cannot be upload in Github. </br>

Here, we only post three exmaples (the first three plots in the .ipynb file), and post our plot codes. But we upload all plots we have ploted.
